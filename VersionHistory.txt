Version History for OptQC

v0.1:
- Rewrote Makefile using automatic variables and pattern matching for conciseness.
- Recoding of MPI_COMPOSITE/v1.1 for more streamlined code (possibly at small expense of performance).
- Removed CPLX implementation for the moment, focus on overhauling REAL implementation first.
- Removed calculation of modified matrix via total Hamming distance minimization - it really wasn't helping (when permutation cost is included).
- Made new file OptQC_CSD - with the intention of coding the CSD process as an object.
- Absorbed functionality from CYGR_CSD.f90, CYGR_BLKCSD.f90, CYGR_CUTGATE.f90, OptQC_Output.f90 and some of CYGR_WRITEF.f90, OptQC_Common.f90 and OptQC_GateCount.f90 into OptQC_CSD.f90.
- Decided to store current progress as v0.1 - especially makefile changes. Object-oriented approach to be expanded upon and to be used in the coming versions.
- Reminder: Restore documentation for CSD functions? Meh, maybe not, or maybe later.

v0.2:
- Moved code for CYG_INDEXTABLE.f90 into OptQC_Common.f90, since well, that should have been done.
- Removed writing of "*_gates.txt" - difficult in general, and not particularly informative.
- Removed writing of the non-reduced solution in favour of just the reduced solution.
- Renamed output .tex file to "*_circuit.tex".
- Deleted files: CYG_INDEXTABLE.f90, CYGR_CSD.f90, CYGR_BLKCSD.f90, CYGR_CUTGATE.f90, OptQC_Output.f90, CYGR_WRITEF.f90, OptQC_GateCount.f90 and OptQC_Mem.f90 due to absorption or removal of functionality.
- Edited makefile correspondingly.
- Moved intermediate GATEY and GATEPI variables from csd_solution object to the csd_generator object.
- Fixed writing function for csd_solution - double precision changed to integer. Minor edits for clarity in said function.
- Defined the csd_solution_set object as a collection of csd_solution objects.
- Minor design changes to csd_solution and csd_solution_set objects.
- Further editing of OptQC_Main.f90 file.
- Edited OptQC_Perm.f90 to use objects in OptQC_CSD.f90.
- UGH DEBUGGING.
- Modified margins of .tex output.
- Decided to store current progress as v0.2 - planning to make another object to handle file output. WHAI >_>

v0.3:
- MOAR OBJECTS RAWR. Specifically for file output, called csd_write_handle.
- Added usage of csd_write_handle to csd_solution and csd_solution_set objects.
- Added usage of csd_write_handle to OptQC_Main.f90.
- UGH MOAR DEBUGGING.
- FIX GRAPHICAL ISSUES - DONE AND DONE!!!
- Checked convention for permutations - it is the assumed U = P^T U' P. HUZZAH!
- Compared with results from old code (MPI_COMPOSTITE/Test/) - initial decomposition results are different (with this one being more optimal). What the magical pony - clean code OP T_T
- Verified results by multiplying out all the gates in a circuit using debugging code.
- Modified output precision for gate parameter values.
- Note: The convention U = P^T U' P means that 1st matrix in array is the last to be applied. Hence, order of output in csd_solution_set_write_circuit has been reversed.
- Fixed unusage of sgn parameter by introducing the neg logical element in the csd_solution, csd_solution_set, csd_generator and csd_write_handle objects.
- TODO: Paradoxial relationship between visual prettiness and accuracy - currently about 10^-5 error for 4 decimal places. Leaving it for now.
- Decided to store current progress as v0.3 - need to add the qubit permutation nonsense in the next version.

v0.4:
- UGH time to add qubit permutation stuff.
- Added subroutines qperm_compute(), qperm_generate() and qperm_reverse() for qubit permutations in OptQC_Perm.f90.
- Modified OptQC_Main.f90 to use the qubit permutation stuffs.
- Checked that qperm_generate() is working correctly - fixed the root process to have the identity qubit permutation.
- Modified init_random_seed() to be process dependent.
- TODO: Possibly relook at usage of system_clock() in init_random_seed() in an MPI environment? Also maybe change usage of random_number() in RINT() to an MPI function instead?
- Debugged qperm_compute() using ALL THE MAGIC.
- Updated OptQC_Main.f90 with usage of qperm stuffs.
- Done and done - verified results with the SWAP gates added in! IT WORKS! HUZZAH!
- Decided to store current progress as v0.4 - planning to add mechanism to keep changing initial permutation until number of gates is lower, and also to muck around with simulated annealing parameters for optimal results.

v0.5:
- LET'S DO IT!
- Edited OptQC_Main.f90 to cycle non-root processes until the initial number of reduced gates is at least as low as that of the root process (i.e. the identity qubit permutation).
- Checked init_random_seed() and RINT() - conclusion being it should yield different results for different processes.
- Checked that rerolling permutations isn't the cause of the exceptionally long program runtime - perhaps the file writing?
- Adding object prog_args to encapsulate all arguments to the program - makes passing it less convoluted.
- Added two extra parameters: PERM_ITER_LIM abd TOL_COEFF.
- Edited makefile correspondingly.
- Added flags -warn all -nogen-interfaces for debugging purposes, and -xHost -ipo for optimization.
- Spent 3 days debugging a weird error - only to realize that qperm_process() was being called with one less argument than it should have. WHAI COMPILER SO DUMB (EVEN WITH WARNING MESSAGES ENABLED) >_>
- Everything looks fixed now - phew. Still testing results for different parameters.
- TODO: Test using non-reduced number of gates as objective function instead?
- TODO: Remove output of gateseq.txt plz.
- Decided to store current progress as v0.5 - planning to WRITE ALL THE CPLX CODE in the next version.
